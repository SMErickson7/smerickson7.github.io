            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The Sales team relies on sending free product samples to close deals, but the request process was a
                manual bottleneck. Sales Engineers (SEs) used a static PDF form that allowed for incomplete data,
                missing project IDs, and bypassed approval limits.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Friction</h5>
            <p><strong>The "Data Janitor" Problem:</strong> Customer Service (CS) spent hours chasing SEs to fix errors
                or gather missing addresses instead of processing orders.</p>
            <p><strong>Shadow Spend:</strong> High-value requests often skipped the required manager approval because
                the "rules" lived in a policy document, not the form logic.</p>
            <p><strong>Zero ROI Tracking:</strong> Requests were trapped in PDFs and emails, making it impossible to
                correlate "Samples Sent" to "Deals Closed."</p>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-5">
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Goals</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Drive Process Transparency and Compliance:</strong> Establish a clear, auditable workflow to
                    ensure all requests adhere to the defined approval policy, eliminating unauthorized requests and
                    "shadow spend."</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminate Manual Data Validation:</strong> Drastically reduce human interference by
                    requiring project IDs, product IDs, prices, and customer information, and routing requests for
                    approval based on calculated total costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable Strategic ROI Tracking:</strong> Create a structured data pipeline that links sample
                    requests directly to active CRM projects, providing management with clear, quantifiable insights
                    into sample spend and closed deals.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="product-approach" class="mb-5">
            <h3>The Product Approach</h3>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Role</h5>
            <p><strong>Product Owner & Developer</strong></p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Stakeholder Discovery</h5>
            <p>Before building a single flow, I treated this as an internal product launch. I interviewed Sales (the
                users), Customer Service (the processors), and Management (the approvers) to map the disconnects and
                align the solution with their core needs.</p>
            <ul class="list sspr">
                <li><strong>Sales (The Users):</strong> Their primary requirement was <strong>speed</strong>. They were
                    frustrated by the static PDF form that frequently led to back-and-forth communication with Customer
                    Service regarding missing Project IDs or incomplete shipping data. The ideal state for them was a
                    fast, frictionless process that moved their deal forward without administrative roadblocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Service (The Processors):</strong> Their core pain point was the <strong>"data
                        janitor" problem</strong>. They were spending up to 30% of their time manually validating data,
                    chasing Sales Engineers for missing information, and ensuring the request had the correct approval.
                    Their goal was to receive "clean" and complete requests that were ready for immediate entry.</li>
                <li><strong>Management (The Approvers):</strong> Their main objective was <strong>control and
                        insight</strong>. The policy for high-value approvals was bypassed, creating "Shadow Spend."
                    They needed a clear, auditable trail that guaranteed compliance and, most importantly, structured
                    data that could correlate sample costs directly to successful deals for ROI analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Aligning the Stakeholder Triad</h5>
            <p>The legacy process created friction because the three key groups had conflicting needs. My goal was to
                design a workflow that didn't just "compromise," but actually solved the core pain point for each group:
            </p>
            <ul class="list sspr">
                <li><strong>Sales (Need: Speed)</strong> They viewed the old process as a "waste of time" that kept them
                    from selling.
                    They needed a frictionless way to request samples without manual paperwork.</li>
                <li><strong>Management (Need: Control)</strong> They felt the old process was "leaky" and lacked
                    oversight. They needed strict adherence to the approval hierarchy to prevent unauthorized spending
                    and overall transparency to all requests being submitted.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Service (Need: Efficiency)</strong> This group was suffering the most. They were
                    acting as "Data Janitors", constantly pausing their actual work to hunt down missing addresses,
                    verify approval
                    policies manually, and chase managers for signatures. They bore the entire mental load of
                    communicating status updates to stakeholders.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="solution" class="mb-5">
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Front-End (Data Integrity)</h5>
            <p>I replaced the PDF with a dynamic <strong>Microsoft Form</strong>. I implemented
                "Required Fields" validation, forcing Sales Engineers to provide all necessary Project IDs and
                customer information upfront. This eliminated the back-and-forth for Customer Service.</p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">The Logic Engine (Conditional Governance)</h5>
            <p>This was the core engineering challenge. I didn't just want a simple approval; I needed a smart logic
                gate. I built a Power Automate flow that:
            <ul class="list sspr">
                <li><strong>Calculates Value:</strong> It reads the requested items and calculates the total
                    monetary value.</li>
                <li><strong>Applies the "$1K Threshold":</strong> I engineered a conditional split:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Under $1,000:</strong> The request is auto-approved and routed directly to
                            Customer Care,
                            drastically reducing cycle time for low-risk requests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Over $1,000:</strong> The system triggers a dynamic approval workflow. It
                            queries the
                            <strong>Authorization Matrix</strong> (hosted in SharePoint) to route the request to
                            the specific
                            Manager, Director, or C-Level executive required, based strictly on the Requestor's
                            Role and the Total Request Value.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Back-End (The Single Source of Truth)</h5>
            <p>All requests are logged automatically to a SharePoint List. I designed the data schema to align with our
                ERP structure (including fields for <strong>SAP Material IDs</strong> and <strong>SD Document
                    IDs</strong>), ensuring the data is structured correctly for manual entry now and ready for
                integration in the future. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="results" class="mb-5">
            <h3>The Results</h3>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Reduced Cycle Time</h5>
            <p>The Customer Service no longer manually validates data; they receive "clean," pre-approved orders ready
                for entry.</p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">100% Policy Compliance</h5>
            <p>The system prevents requests from skipping the approval hierarchy.</p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Data Visibility</h5>
            <p>We moved from "black box" PDF attachments to a structured database, enabling us to finally track the
                volume of samples against closed deals.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h3>Future Roadmap</h3>
            <p>While the current MVP successfully standardized the workflow, Phase 2 will migrate the front-end from
                Microsoft Forms to a custom <strong>Power App</strong> to enable deep data integration and advanced
                governance.</p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Data Lake Integration (Automated Validation)</h5>
            <p>I will connect the Power App directly to our internal Data Lake. This will allow real-time validation of
                <strong>customer information, project IDs</strong>, and <strong>material IDs</strong> against the master
                data. Crucially, it will automatically fetch <strong>list prices</strong>, significantly reducing the
                number of manual fields the user needs to complete.
            </p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Role-Based Management Dashboards</h5>
            <p>I am designing a "Manager View" within the app that features <strong>Row-Level Security (RLS)</strong>.
                This ensures data governance by filtering views based on hierarchy:</p>
            <ul class="list sspr">
                <li><em>Regional Managers</em> will only see requests from their specific territory (e.g., US East).
                </li>
                <li><em>Directors</em> will have a consolidated view of all regions under their purview.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Pipeline Velocity & Conversion Analytics</h5>
            <p>I will implement stage-tracking analytics to measure how fast opportunities move through the sales cycle
                after a sample is received. This view will explicitly highlight "Stalled Projects" (opportunities that
                failed to progress post-sample) allowing leadership to calculate the true ROI of sales samples.</p>
            <h5 class="ssrp-h5">Product Demand Intelligence</h5>
            <p>A separate trend dashboard will aggregate request data to visualize which product series and categories
                are in highest demand. This provides Product Management with data on prospective customers testing their
                products.</p>
